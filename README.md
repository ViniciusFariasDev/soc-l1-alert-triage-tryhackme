This repository documents my completion of the **SOC L1 Alert Triage** room on TryHackMe.

The objective of this lab is to simulate the daily workflow of a **SOC Level 1 analyst**, focusing on alert triage within a SIEM environment. The room provides hands-on experience with prioritizing, investigating, and classifying security alerts.
